        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence EI, is the ability to utilise and relate to our emotions in a healthy way</p>
        <h2>How is is different to Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Intelligence Quotient IQ, is all about logic and the working out of things, EI is about emotions, as humans we are a mix of both.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>EI is important to manage our feelings about things, it is not something that should be just tolerated but celebrated. Our emotions can often provide intuition about situations more quickly then intellect can't, the opportunity of EI is that we can also learn how to perform the best at work and with others. </p>
