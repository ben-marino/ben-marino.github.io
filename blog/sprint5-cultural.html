        <h1>Sprint 5 Cultural - Foundation Core Skills</h1>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>How close you are to giving up when it all makes sense
            How persistence pays
            Google is your friend</p>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>The role of values, empathy and self awareness plays in programming
            I'd say that understanding how the people you work with aren't machines they just work with them is important but 
            subtle distinction to make.
            Valuing others contributions and working with others who value yours is important.
            Being aware of how you're doing and being comfortable to give and take as appropriate</p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>The amount of built in functions to help you in Javascript</p>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>Looping and listening was a challenge!</p>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>Because it is the teaching to fish rather then giving a man a fish that is important, the syntax and language stuff
            can and will change it's important to learn to learn over the lifetime as a web developer that is timeless
            </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>No in my own experience working in IT I would say it's these things which I didn't appreciate at the start have been the 
            secret weapon</p>
            <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>I'm hoping to get more into web development and being a full stack developer, I've been in programming roles for some time now and want a refresher</p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>I think they are both the same thing for me, I'm used to doing things when it comes to programming in a certain way and it will be a challenge to break out of that</p>
            <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>Managing my time commitments, I do train for a couple of hours in the morning before class starts but have 45 minutes before class starts to get home and ready for the day to start</p>
            <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>Working with others remotely</p>
            <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>To challenge myself to learn new ways of coding</p>
