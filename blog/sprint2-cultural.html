        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>My Long Term Plan</h2>
        <p>I have worked as a developer for a while now, so why return to study right? Well I wanted to enhance web development skills as I have spent more time with Database and Coding, less on the frond end. Ideally to become a full stack developer</p>
        <h2>Human Skills</h2>
        <p>I'd like to develop more collaborative skills as a programmer remotely. This pandemic might be with us for some time so the ability to work remotely would be great if I can pick up some contracting work remotely that would be the best.</p>
        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>Patience and persistence are my great strengths I have a quiet resolve and enjoy working through difficult challenges. My limitation is I'm not a sprinter, it's a Marathon not a short race and in my experience it works out better over the long term to be efficient where you spend your energy. </p>
        <h2>Commitment and workload</h2>
        <p>Bootcamp will be a big commitment both to support and maximise the opportunity it presents, I will prioritise the class and challenge time but I do have a set morning routine of running and lifting which happily will be done before the scheduled class time.</p>
        <p>I will finish training just before 8 am so will need to set myself up daily to be ready for the start of class, I'm finalising a few things but will have this set up in the next fortnight.</p>
        <p>Being physically active helps calm my mind to focus, and more sustainably over the bootcamp period.</p>
        <h2>Support network</h2>
        <p>I feel comfortable asking for help from my existing network as well as others at EDA in my cohort, facilitators.</p>
        <p>From the EDA facilitation team, the support I expect is regular checkins and friendly and open dialog.</p>
