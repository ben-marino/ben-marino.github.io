        <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration </h1>
        <p>
            I have previously to starting study done a lot of work on this, I have had my own struggles with depression and while it was a dark path at one time I am happy to have gone through it all.
        </p>
        <p>I wouldn't really know myself if I hadn't been through a lot of that, I have pushed through my internal battles and external ones running Ultra Marathons all day and most of the night. Perserverance, patience and being persistent are an important part of who I am, I do have a wide range of friends through work and training, running.</p>
        <p>They would describe me as friendly, easy going chilled and quiet. I am quiet more then shy, when I'm engaged I have a lot to say but often when I don't it's because I'm enjoying my own thoughts</p>
        <p>Some of the significant things I am proud of having done is completing my first 100km ultra in 2015 before I'd run my first marathon, I was physcially ready having trained significantly but it was more the emotional battle of getting through it that was really challenging.
            Fortunately I had a good friend to run with me towards the end.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>One of the hardest decisions I have had to make was in this race, I really wanted to give up and my support team talked me around.
            It does sound like an odd thing to think about as being a moral or ethical choice, but not giving up on myself was the hardest and best thing I did.
        </p>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>Honesty and compassion are things I value, to be clear and accepting of other people and myself I have cultivated.</p>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <p>Patience and persistence are my greatest strengths, and I view life as a journey so focus on enjoying where I am. I have a few good friends I share my experience with.</p>
