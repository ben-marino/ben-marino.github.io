    <h1>Sprint 4 Technical</h1>
    <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>At the end of last weeks sprint I couldn't share some of my work on DOM interactions, normally I have a system for sharing the work I do with my facilitator to see my progress using a platform called GitHub</p>
    <p>I had 'saved' it without seeing that it had given an error message, it wasn't until my facilitator asked where this work was did I try again and noticed the error message</p>
    <p>I tried, restarting, then logging out of and into again, unfortunately none of these fixed the problem I had so I had to recreate the entry and copy the completed work and save again.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the simple start again approach is the one that works!</p>
    <h2>Elegant solution to a problem</h2>
    <p>I had a problem where I needed to filter for a matching word but they could be different and random capitalisation. My solution was to convert the input string to lowercase before filtering.</p>
