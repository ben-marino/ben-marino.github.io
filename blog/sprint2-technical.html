    <h1>Best Practice in the Use of Classes and IDs in Stylesheets</h1>
    
    <h3>11 September 2020</h3>
    
    <p>
      The main consideration when using classes and opposed to IDs in a stylesheet is when it is important to be specific.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example all the buttons on a page may have a button class as general elements which all share something.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might have a special id for the active page perhaps and it's the only one on the page. You are talking about just that one thing, you shouldn't have more than one element on a page sharing and ID
