        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>The old fashioned view was that our brains are hardwired, in reality we have the ability to change over our lives. Old dogs can learn new tricks after all</p>
        <p>The best example I can give of this is that I run and lift a lot so my brain learns to do both those things very well, there is a strong mind and body connection. When you use your muscle though it causes damage which your body repairs and strenghtens when this happens the muscle strands shorten. Stretching does help but every 3 weeks or so I will get a deep tissue massage, this will lengthen the muscle strands back to what they should be.</p>
        <p>This all sounds wonderful except my brain and body has adapted around the shortened muscles and any tighness or distortions it may have had so it is a process of relearning what is level when running, how to deadlift or do a pullup.</p>
        <p>This is Neuralplasticity in action, the timing of getting a massage is a good window for learning new things</p>

        <h2>What is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
        <p>A Growth mindset is not having a fixed idea of what is possible and how things should be done, or what is possible and even more importantly reframing failure as not being final or fatal.</p>
        <p>More thinking of supposed 'failure' as being an important learning opportunity to adjust your approach.</p>
        <p>This is something I have done some of my own exloration into and it can be a hard thing to always remember when things don't go well. I feel this year is a lesson in the importatnce of all these things.</p>
        <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/08/6-ways-a-crisis-can-help-you-cultivate-a-growth-mindset">Here is a great link on 6 ways a crisis can help to cultivate a growth mindset</a></p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>EI is important to manage our feelings about things, it is not something that should be just tolerated but celebrated. Our emotions can often provide intuition about situations more quickly then intellect can't, the opportunity of EI is that we can also learn how to perform the best at work and with others. </p>
